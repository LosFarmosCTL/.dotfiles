# Dotfiles

This repo contains the dotfiles I currently use for a macOS system.

I am using [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) as my shell, the main content of this repo is my lua-based neovim configuration.

## Cloning, forking, etc.

I would not advise anyone to just clone or fork this, I haven't made any effort for my config to be either system-independent or easy to install, all symlinks are currently created manually and there are a lot of dependencies on installed binaries.

If there is something in here you like, feel free to just yoink it though.
